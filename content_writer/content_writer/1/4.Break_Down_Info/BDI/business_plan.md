**California Tea Shop Business Plan**
=====================================

The revised business plan provides a more realistic and robust plan for opening a tea shop in California. The initial budget of $1000 USD was unrealistic, and a revised budget of $50,000 to $100,000 USD is recommended. With careful planning, research, and execution, the tea shop can become a successful and profitable business. The shop will offer a variety of tea flavors and blends, as well as food and snack options. The target market is health-conscious individuals and tea enthusiasts in the local community. By providing a unique and welcoming atmosphere, the tea shop aims to become a popular destination in California.
